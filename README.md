# 🧠 Persona-Driven LLM Pipeline: Fine-Tuning LLaMA for Synthetic Audience Feedback

This repository showcases my **end-to-end AI engineering workflow** in building a **domain-specific Large Language Model (LLM)** for generating **natural, contextual social media comments**.

The focus of this project is **model development**, covering:
- Data engineering (scraping & synthetic data generation)
- Prompt & instruction design
- LLM fine-tuning using **QLoRA**
- Model evaluation & deployment to Hugging Face

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a **custom fine-tuned LLM** that can generate **human-like, relevant social media comments** based on post descriptions optimized for real-world usage and lightweight deployment.

This project was developed as part of my **AI Engineer internship (MBKM)** and reflects **industry-oriented AI practices**, not just API usage.

## 🧠 AI Engineering Scope

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- **Real-world data**: Instagram comment scraping using `Instaloader`
- **Synthetic data**: Instruction–Input–Output generation using **LLaMA**
- Final dataset size:
  - 3,385 real comments
  - 1,157 synthetic samples

### 2️⃣ Data Processing & EDA
- Text cleaning & normalization
- Duplicate & irrelevant data removal
- Character length analysis (instruction / input / output)
- WordCloud & distribution analysis

### 3️⃣ Model Fine-Tuning
- Base Model: **LLaMA 3.x**
- Fine-tuning method: **QLoRA (via Unsloth)**
- Training strategy:
  - Parameter-efficient tuning
  - Overfitting control (learning rate, epochs)
  - Training & validation loss monitoring

### 4️⃣ Model Deployment
- Fine-tuned adapters pushed to **Hugging Face**
- Models ready for downstream integration
